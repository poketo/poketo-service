üç° Poketo API
============

Lightweight backend service for the Poketo manga reader.

Stores minimal data about collections (to sync across devices), and scrapes [MangaUpdates](https://mangaupdates.com) to get information about new chapters.

Supported Sites / Groups:
* [Helvetica Scans](http://helveticascans.com/)
* [Meraki Scans](http://merakiscans.com/)
* [MangaUpdates](http://mangaupdates.com/)
* It's easy to add more! [Make an issue](https://github.com/rosszurowski/poketo-api) to request a group you'd like.

Deployed on [Now](https://now.sh). Feel free to fork this repo on [Glitch](https://glitch.me) if you want to run your own instance.
