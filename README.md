üç° Pocky API
============

Lightweight backend service for the Pocky manga reader.

Stores minimal data about collections (to sync across devices), and scrapes [MangaUpdates](https://mangaupdates.com) to get information about new chapters.

Built on [Glitch](https://glitch.com) at [`manga-reader-api-ef202c.glitch.me`](https://manga-reader-api-ef202c.glitch.me). Fork it if you'd like!
